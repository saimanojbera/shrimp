                                        AQUA ROBOT TO DETECT DEAD SHRIMP

Objective:

Shrimp production is one of the major profitable cultivations for farmers. But now-a-days, shrimp production has been declined because of the diseases caused by viruses which lead to the death of the shrimps in a very short span of time. Moreover, if one shrimp is affected by virus, it spreads virus to other shrimps within a short span of time. Due to this, farmers have to go through huge loss in the yield. 
In order to reduce this loss, the idea of “Aqua Robot” has been proposed. When this robot detects a dead or virus affected shrimp, an alarm along with the information about the location of dead/ virus affected shrimp will be sent to the farmer so that the farmer could take measures to remove virus affected shrimp from the pond.

Implementation:

Step-1: Designing a dataset of shrimp images.

Step-2: Creating an object detection model to detect dead/virus affected shrimp.

Step-3: Embedding the application into the mobile app.

Step-4: Notifying the farmers through the app when it detects dead/virus affected shrimp.


Applications:

•	Reduces the losses to farmers in shrimp yielding.
•	Reduces the losses to investors in shrimp production.
•	Increases the growth of shrimp production.

Final Result:

Thus, project entitled “AQUA ROBOT TO DETECT DEAD SHRIMP “detects dead/ virus affected shrimps and informs the farmer about it along with the location of where the affected/ dead shrimp was found so that farmer could take measures to remove those shrimps from the pond. This reduces reduction in shrimp growth and loss in the shrimp cultivation due to dead/ virus affected shrimps.
